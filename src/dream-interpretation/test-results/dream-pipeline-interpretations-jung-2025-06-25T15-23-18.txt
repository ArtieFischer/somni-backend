🌙 Dream dream-001 - 23 year old female
================================================================================

📝 Dream narrative:
"The walls were breathing, expanding and contracting like lungs. I touched one and it was warm, almost alive. There were no doors, just endless corridors that kept folding into themselves. I could hear my mother's voice but it was coming from inside the walls, speaking in a language I've never heard but somehow understood. Everything was the color of old photographs - that sepia tone. I was holding something heavy in my hands but when I looked down, there was nothing there, just the weight."

🌙 Dream dream-002 - 45 year old male
================================================================================

📝 Dream narrative:
"I was made of glass, transparent and fragile. People walked past me and through me as if I wasn't there. When I tried to speak, geometric shapes came out of my mouth instead of words - triangles, circles, spirals floating in the air. There was a red thread tied around my ankle, leading somewhere I couldn't see. The sun was setting but also rising at the same time. I remember feeling like I was forgetting something important with each step I took."
