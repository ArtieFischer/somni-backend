🚀 Testing Three-Stage Interpreter
==================================

📝 Dream: "I was in my childhood home, but the walls were made of glass. I could see through them to an endless ocean. My mother was there, but she looked younger, like in old photographs. She was trying to tell me something important, but when she spoke, only bubbles came out of her mouth. I felt anxious because I couldn't understand her. Suddenly, the floor became water too, and I was floating between the house and the ocean."
