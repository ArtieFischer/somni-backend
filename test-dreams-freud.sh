Then my old teddy bear came to life and started giving me cooking advice, but it was all wrong - like telling me to add glitter to the soup and use crayons as seasoning. The weirdest part was that Gordon Ramsay started nodding approvingly at the teddy bears suggestions and said I was finally getting somewhere.
