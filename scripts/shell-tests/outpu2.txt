Flirting with Marcus, the best friend of your boyfriend, signifies an expression of the libido seeking new outlets, possibly indicating a fixation at the genital stage with a focus on exploration and variety. The act of sneaking into a bedroom and making out with Marcus reveals a wish for secrecy and the thrill of forbidden actions, which is a classic manifestation of the unconscious mind's ability to create scenarios that fulfill repressed desires. Your inability to stop yourself and the intense attraction you feel suggest that your psyche is navigating the tension between civilization's demands and primitive, instinctual drives.

This dynamic is reminiscent of my case study of Dora, where repressed desires and societal expectations led to hysterical symptoms. The thrill you experience underscores the libidinal charge attached to this transgressive encounter, suggesting an unresolved Oedipal conflict where desires for forbidden objects continue to influence your emotional landscape.
