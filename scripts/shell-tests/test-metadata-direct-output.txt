Test 3
========================================
Dream: I was at a party with my boyfriend when I started flirting heavily with his best friend, Marcus. My boyfriend went to get drinks and Marcus and I snuck into a bedroom. We started making out passionately and I felt this intense attraction and excitement. Even though I love my boyfriend, I couldn't stop myself. We almost had sex but then I heard my boyfriend calling my name. I felt guilty but also thrilled by the forbidden nature of it.

Dream: I was ice skating on this huge, beautiful frozen lake with my sister. The winter landscape was breathtaking - snow-covered pine trees everywhere and the clearest blue sky.

Test 6
========================================
Dream: I was trapped inside this enormous, maze-like house and desperately trying to find a way out. Every time I opened a door hoping to find an exit, it was just another closet filled with old clothes and junk. The house seemed to go on forever with endless hallways and rooms. I was getting more and more panicked as I ran from door to door, but they were all just closets. I could hear something chasing me through the house, getting closer, but I couldn't escape.
