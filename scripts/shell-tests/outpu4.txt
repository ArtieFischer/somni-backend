Displacement occurs as the dreamer's anxiety is transferred to an external entity chasing them. Symbolization is evident in the doors and closets, which signify the dreamer's attempts to access and resolve unconscious conflicts. Secondary revision is at play as the dreamer's mind rationalizes the experience, creating a coherent narrative.",
    "interpretation": "I detect a profound sense of disorientation and frustration within you, as if you feel trapped in a never-ending cycle of anxiety and uncertainty. The maze-like house represents your psyche, with its complex network of thoughts, feelings, and desires. Your desperate attempts to find a way out signify your ego's struggle to navigate and resolve these unconscious conflicts. The doors that lead only to closets filled with old clothes and junk suggest that you are trying to access and discard repressed memories and desires, but they remain elusive. The hallways and rooms that seem to go on forever indicate the vastness and complexity of your unconscious mind. The entity chasing you represents the superego, which is exerting pressure on your ego to conform to societal norms and expectations. This dream is a manifestation of your id's struggle for expression and your ego's attempts to regulate and balance these opposing forces. I sense that this dream is connected to your childhood experiences, perhaps related to feelings of confinement or restriction. Your current life dynamics, with their attendant anxieties and pressures, have activated these unconscious conflicts, leading to this dream.",
