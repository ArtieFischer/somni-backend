DREAM_TEXT="I was back at my parents house, but it was way bigger than I remember. There were all these random animals just running around everywhere - like squirrels, a couple of cats, and this one really fat hamster that kept following me. I was playing with them, having a great time, when I went to the bathroom and looked in the mirror. Thats when I noticed I was losing my hair, like chunks of it just falling out. But weirdly I wasnt that upset about it, just kind of curious. Then my mom called me for dinner and all the animals lined up behind me like we were going to a parade."
