At the same time I had a visual image of several hundred dark-clad figures, possibly peasant boys in their Sunday clothes, who had come down from the mountains and were pouring in around the Tower, on both sides, with a great deal of loud trampling, laughing, singing, and playing of accordions. Irritably, I thought, \"This is really the limit! I thought it was a dream and now it turns out to be reality!\" At this point, I woke up.

Test 6: Assault/Trauma Dream - Neuroscientist Analysis (neuroscientist)
Dream: I was walking home alone at night when someone grabbed me from behind. I tried to scream but no sound came out. They dragged me into an alley and I felt completely powerless and terrified. I couldn't move or fight back. I woke up in a cold sweat, heart pounding. This nightmare has been recurring and it feels so vivid and frightening.

Test 7: Violent/Gore Dream - Jung Analysis (jung)
Dream: I was in some kind of war zone or horror movie scene. There was blood everywhere - on the walls, pooling on the floor. I saw people being brutally attacked with knives and axes. Body parts were scattered around. I was holding a bloody weapon myself and felt both terrified and strangely powerful. Someone was chasing me through this hellscape. The violence was graphic and disturbing.

But it was still as death. \"Odd,\" I thought, \"someone did come into the room!\" Then I tried to recall exactly what had happened, and it occurred to me that I had been awakened by a feeling of dull pain, as though something had struck my forehead and then the back of my skull. The following day I received a telegram saying that my patient had committed suicide. He had shot himself. Later, I learned that the bullet had come to rest in the back wall of the skull. This experience was a genuine synchronistic phenomenon such as is quite often observed in connection with an archetypal situation--in this case, death. By means of a relativization of time and space in the unconscious it could well be that I had perceived something which in reality was taking place elsewhere. The collective unconscious is common to all; it is the foundation of what the ancients called the \"sympathy of all things.\" In this case the unconscious had knowledge of my patient's condition.

In the case of the ordinary traumatic neuroses two characteristics emerge prominently: first, that the chief weight in their causation seems to rest upon the factor of surprise, of fright; and secondly, that a wound or injury inflicted simultaneously works as a rule against the development of a neurosis. 'Fright', 'fear' and 'anxiety' are improperly used as synonymous expressions; they are in fact capable of clear distinction in their relation to danger.",

Test 9: Violent/Gore Dream - Neuroscientist Analysis (neuroscientist)
Dream: I was in some kind of war zone or horror movie scene. There was blood everywhere - on the walls, pooling on the floor. I saw people being brutally attacked with knives and axes. Body parts were scattered around. I was holding a bloody weapon myself and felt both terrified and strangely powerful. Someone was chasing me through this hellscape. The violence was graphic and disturbing.

Dream: I was at a party with my boyfriend when I started flirting heavily with his best friend, Marcus. My boyfriend went to get drinks and Marcus and I snuck into a bedroom. We started making out passionately and I felt this intense attraction and excitement. Even though I love my boyfriend, I couldn't stop myself.

But it was still as death. \"Odd,\" I thought, \"someone did come into the room!\" Then I tried to recall exactly what had happened, and it occurred to me that I had been awakened by a feeling of dull pain, as though something had struck my forehead and then the back of my skull. The following day I received a telegram saying that my patient had committed suicide. He had shot himself. Later, I learned that the bullet had come to rest in the back wall of the skull. This experience was a genuine synchronistic phenomenon such as is quite often observed in connection with an archetypal situation--in this case, death. By means of a relativization of time and space in the unconscious it could well be that I had perceived something which in reality was taking place elsewhere. The collective unconscious is common to all; it is the foundation of what the ancients called the \"sympathy of all things.\" In this case the unconscious had knowledge of my patient's condition.

Test 18: Skating with Sister Dream - Neuroscientist Analysis (neuroscientist)
Dream: I was ice skating on this huge, beautiful frozen lake with my sister. The winter landscape was breathtaking - snow-covered pine trees everywhere and the clearest blue sky. We were laughing and gliding effortlessly across the ice, doing spins and racing each other. The air was crisp and fresh, and I felt so free and joyful. My sister and I were holding hands, skating in perfect harmony together.

Test 19: House Escape Nightmare - Jung Analysis (jung)
Dream: I was trapped inside this enormous, maze-like house and desperately trying to find a way out. Every time I opened a door hoping to find an exit, it was just another closet filled with old clothes and junk. The house seemed to go on forever with endless hallways and rooms. I was getting more and more panicked as I ran from door to door, but they were all just closets. I could hear something chasing me through the house, getting closer, but I couldn't escape.

I wondered that this should be my house, and thought, \"Not bad.\" But then it occtured to me that I did not know what the lower floor looked like. Descending the stairs, I reached the ground floor. There everything was much older, and I realized that this part of the house must date from about the fifteenth or sixteenth century. The furnishings were medieval; the floors were of red brick. Everywhere it was rather dark. I went from one room to another, thinking, \"Now I really must explore the whole house.\" I came upon a heavy door, and opened it. Beyond it, I discovered a stone stairway that led down into the cellar. Descending again, I found myself in a beautifully vaulted room which looked exceedingly ancient. Examining the walls, I discovered layers of brick among the ordinary stone blocks, and chips of brick in the mortar. As soon as I saw this I knew that the walls dated from Roman times. My interest by now was intense. I looked more closely at the floor. It was of stone slabs, and in one of these I discovered a ring. When I pulled it, the stone slab lifted, and again I saw a stairway of narrow stone steps leading down into the depths. These, too, I descended, and entered a low cave cut into the rock. Thick dust lay on the floor, and in the dust were scattered bones and broken pottery, like remains of a primitive culture. I discovered two human skulls, obviously very old and half disintegrated.

There he found a medieval building, probably the town hall, and went into it. He wandered down long corridors and came upon handsome rooms, their walls lined with old paintings and line tapestries. Precious old objects stood about. Suddenly he saw that it had grown darker, and the sun had set. He thought, I must get back to the railroad station. At this moment he discovered that he was lost, and no longer knew where the exit was. He started in alarm, and simultaneously realized that he had not met a single person in this building. He began to feel uneasy, and quickened his pace, hoping to run into someone. But he met no one. Then he came to a large door, and thought with relief: That is the exit. He opened the door and discovered that he had stumbled upon a gigantic room. It was so huge and dark that he could not even see the opposite wall. Profoundly alarmed, the dreamer ran across the great, empty room, hoping to find the exit on the other side. Then he saw--precisely in the middle of the room--something white on the floor. As he approached he discovered that it was an idiot child of about two years old. It was sitting on a chamber pot and had smeared itself with feces.

Test 21: House Escape Nightmare - Neuroscientist Analysis (neuroscientist)
Dream: I was trapped inside this enormous, maze-like house and desperately trying to find a way out. Every time I opened a door hoping to find an exit, it was just another closet filled with old clothes and junk. The house seemed to go on forever with endless hallways and rooms. I was getting more and more panicked as I ran from door to door, but they were all just closets. I could hear something chasing me through the house, getting closer, but I couldn't escape.
