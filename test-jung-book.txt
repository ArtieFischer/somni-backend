Chapter 1: Introduction to Dreams

Dreams have fascinated humanity since ancient times. In this chapter, we explore the fundamental principles of dream analysis according to Carl Jung's theoretical framework.

The archetype of the shadow represents the unconscious aspects of our personality. When we dream of dark figures or unknown persons, we may be encountering our shadow self.

Chapter 2: Symbols and Their Meanings

Water in dreams often symbolizes emotions and the unconscious mind. A calm lake might represent peace, while turbulent seas could signify emotional turmoil.

The symbol of the snake has multiple interpretations. It can represent transformation, healing (as in the medical caduceus), or dangerous unconscious forces.
