**Key Requirements:**

- Secure API key management (ElevenLabs API key never exposed to client)
- Audio transcription using ElevenLabs Speech-to-Text
- Integration with Supabase for authentication and data storage
- Railway deployment ready
- Future-proof for conversational AI features
- Rate limiting and security best practices

**MAJOR NEW FEATURE - FREUDIAN DREAM INTERPRETER:**

Expanding our sophisticated AI-powered dream interpretation service to include Dr. Freud alongside the existing Jungian interpreter. The system will now feature two powerful analytical approaches:

- **Jungian Interpreter**: Deep psychological analysis focusing on individuation, shadow work, and archetypal symbols (âœ… **IMPLEMENTED**)
- **Freudian Interpreter**: Classic psychoanalytic interpretation focusing on unconscious desires, repression, and sexual symbolism (âœ… **IMPLEMENTED & REBALANCED**)

**NEW MAJOR FEATURE - NEUROSCIENTIST DREAM INTERPRETER:**

Expanding our sophisticated AI-powered dream interpretation service to include evidence-based neuroscience alongside the existing psychological interpreters. The system will now feature three powerful analytical approaches:

- **Jungian Interpreter**: Deep psychological analysis focusing on individuation, shadow work, and archetypal symbols (âœ… **IMPLEMENTED**)
- **Freudian Interpreter**: Classic psychoanalytic interpretation focusing on unconscious desires, repression, and sexual symbolism (âœ… **IMPLEMENTED & REBALANCED**)
- **Neuroscientist Interpreter**: Evidence-based sleep science interpretation with Dr. Mary Carskadon's warm, educational approach (ðŸ”„ **IN PROGRESS**)

**NEUROSCIENTIST INTERPRETER APPROACH:**

The neuroscientist interpreter will provide evidence-based dream analysis using:

1. **Dr. Mary Carskadon's Voice**: Pioneering sleep researcher with warm, approachable professor personality
2. **Evidence-Based Framework**:
   - Continuity Hypothesis: Connects dreams to recent waking experiences
   - Threat Simulation: Analyzes survival rehearsal patterns
   - NEXTUP Model: Identifies creative problem-solving connections
   - Emotion Regulation: Tracks how REM processes feelings
   - Memory Consolidation: Shows how the brain files experiences
3. **Smart Pattern Detection**: Automatically detects and includes specialized analyses only when relevant
4. **Unique JSON Structure**: Uses brainActivity, continuityLinks, adaptiveFunction, neuroscienceEducation, and reflectiveQuestion instead of traditional symbols
5. **Scientific Yet Accessible Language**: Technical terms explained in parentheses with metaphors

**CURRENT ISSUE - SEXUAL THEME OVER-AVOIDANCE:**

User feedback indicates the Freudian interpreter has overcorrected and is now avoiding sexual themes too much. While we successfully eliminated crude reductionism, we've made Freud too reserved. Authentically Freudian interpretations should include sexual analysis when contextually appropriate - avoiding sexual themes entirely is not true to Freud's approach.

**Enhanced Architecture:**

```

                    â†“                        â†“

      Jung, Freud & Neuroscientist â†’ Structured JSON Responses
```

**Key Innovation**: Triple-interpreter system allowing users to get Jungian (transformative individuation), Freudian (unconscious psychoanalytic), and Neuroscientist (evidence-based sleep science) perspectives on the same dream.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Current Problem Analysis - Sexual Theme Avoidance:

**Root Cause Identification:**

1. **Over-Cautious Guidance**: The prompt contains strong warnings against sexual interpretation:

   - "Not every dream is about sex or parents"
   - "avoid crude reductionism"
   - "Be sophisticated - avoid crude reductionism"
   - This has made the LLM overly hesitant to include sexual analysis even when appropriate

2. **Conditional Sexual Analysis**: The `sexualAnalysis` field is marked as "ONLY if sexual themes are clearly present" with emphasis on "not crude interpretation" - this creates too high a bar for sexual theme detection

3. **Emphasis on Non-Sexual Theories**: The prompt heavily emphasizes Freud's non-sexual theories (death drive, narcissistic injury, ego defenses) without balancing emphasis on libidinal theory

4. **Symbol Detection Not Utilized**: The `identifyPotentialSexualSymbols()` method exists but isn't being leveraged in the prompt to guide appropriate sexual analysis

### Authentic Freudian Balance Needed:

**What Freud Actually Believed:**

- Sexual drive (libido) is fundamental to human psychology and dream formation
- Sexual symbolism is pervasive in dreams, but not the only interpretation
- Psychosexual development continues influencing adult dreams
- Sexual repression creates many psychological symptoms and dream distortions
- Sexual themes should be addressed directly but thoughtfully, not avoided

**The Rebalancing Challenge:**

- Maintain sophistication while allowing appropriate sexual analysis
- Include sexual themes when contextually relevant without being reductive
- Balance sexual interpretation with other psychoanalytic concepts
- Preserve therapeutic appropriateness while being authentically Freudian

### Technical Challenges for Freudian Rebalancing:

1. **Prompt Guidance Refinement**: Rewrite guidance to encourage appropriate sexual analysis rather than discourage it
2. **Sexual Symbol Integration**: Better leverage the sexual symbol detection system in prompts
3. **Contextual Sexual Analysis**: Create clearer criteria for when sexual analysis is appropriate
4. **Authentic Voice Maintenance**: Ensure Freud doesn't become crude while addressing sexual themes
5. **Testing for Balance**: Develop tests that verify sexual themes are included when appropriate

### Architecture Decisions for Freudian Rebalancing:

- **Prompt Refinement**: Update `buildOutputFormat()` with balanced sexual theme guidance
- **Symbol Integration**: Better utilize `identifyPotentialSexualSymbols()` output in prompts
- **Conditional Logic**: Refine when `sexualAnalysis` field should be included
- **Voice Calibration**: Maintain Dr. Freud's authentic voice while addressing sexual content
- **Quality Testing**: Create specific tests for sexual theme appropriateness
