# Somni Backend Service - ElevenLabs Integration Layer

## Background and Motivation

Building a dedicated backend service that acts as a secure gateway for all ElevenLabs interactions for a mobile app. This service will handle transcription now and conversational AI in the future, integrating with Supabase for data management and authentication.

**Key Requirements:**

- Secure API key management (ElevenLabs API key never exposed to client)
- Audio transcription using ElevenLabs Speech-to-Text
- Integration with Supabase for authentication and data storage
- Railway deployment ready
- Future-proof for conversational AI features
- Rate limiting and security best practices

**MAJOR NEW FEATURE - FREUDIAN DREAM INTERPRETER:**

Expanding our sophisticated AI-powered dream interpretation service to include Dr. Freud alongside the existing Jungian interpreter. The system will now feature two powerful analytical approaches:

- **Jungian Interpreter**: Deep psychological analysis focusing on individuation, shadow work, and archetypal symbols (✅ **IMPLEMENTED**)
- **Freudian Interpreter**: Classic psychoanalytic interpretation focusing on unconscious desires, repression, and sexual symbolism (🔄 **NEEDS REBALANCING**)

**CURRENT ISSUE - SEXUAL THEME OVER-AVOIDANCE:**

User feedback indicates the Freudian interpreter has overcorrected and is now avoiding sexual themes too much. While we successfully eliminated crude reductionism, we've made Freud too reserved. Authentically Freudian interpretations should include sexual analysis when contextually appropriate - avoiding sexual themes entirely is not true to Freud's approach.

**Enhanced Architecture:**

```
Mobile App → Supabase Edge Functions → Somni Backend Service → OpenRouter API
                    ↓                        ↓
               Dream Interpretation     Llama 4 Scout (Free)

          Jung & Freud Interpreters → Structured JSON Responses
```

**Key Innovation**: Dual-interpreter system allowing users to get both Jungian (transformative individuation) and Freudian (unconscious psychoanalytic) perspectives on the same dream.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Current Problem Analysis - Sexual Theme Avoidance:

**Root Cause Identification:**

1. **Over-Cautious Guidance**: The prompt contains strong warnings against sexual interpretation:

   - "Not every dream is about sex or parents"
   - "avoid crude reductionism"
   - "Be sophisticated - avoid crude reductionism"
   - This has made the LLM overly hesitant to include sexual analysis even when appropriate

2. **Conditional Sexual Analysis**: The `sexualAnalysis` field is marked as "ONLY if sexual themes are clearly present" with emphasis on "not crude interpretation" - this creates too high a bar for sexual theme detection

3. **Emphasis on Non-Sexual Theories**: The prompt heavily emphasizes Freud's non-sexual theories (death drive, narcissistic injury, ego defenses) without balancing emphasis on libidinal theory

4. **Symbol Detection Not Utilized**: The `identifyPotentialSexualSymbols()` method exists but isn't being leveraged in the prompt to guide appropriate sexual analysis

### Authentic Freudian Balance Needed:

**What Freud Actually Believed:**

- Sexual drive (libido) is fundamental to human psychology and dream formation
- Sexual symbolism is pervasive in dreams, but not the only interpretation
- Psychosexual development continues influencing adult dreams
- Sexual repression creates many psychological symptoms and dream distortions
- Sexual themes should be addressed directly but thoughtfully, not avoided

**The Rebalancing Challenge:**

- Maintain sophistication while allowing appropriate sexual analysis
- Include sexual themes when contextually relevant without being reductive
- Balance sexual interpretation with other psychoanalytic concepts
- Preserve therapeutic appropriateness while being authentically Freudian

### Technical Challenges for Freudian Rebalancing:

1. **Prompt Guidance Refinement**: Rewrite guidance to encourage appropriate sexual analysis rather than discourage it
2. **Sexual Symbol Integration**: Better leverage the sexual symbol detection system in prompts
3. **Contextual Sexual Analysis**: Create clearer criteria for when sexual analysis is appropriate
4. **Authentic Voice Maintenance**: Ensure Freud doesn't become crude while addressing sexual themes
5. **Testing for Balance**: Develop tests that verify sexual themes are included when appropriate

### Architecture Decisions for Freudian Rebalancing:

- **Prompt Refinement**: Update `buildOutputFormat()` with balanced sexual theme guidance
- **Symbol Integration**: Better utilize `identifyPotentialSexualSymbols()` output in prompts
- **Conditional Logic**: Refine when `sexualAnalysis` field should be included
- **Voice Calibration**: Maintain Dr. Freud's authentic voice while addressing sexual content
- **Quality Testing**: Create specific tests for sexual theme appropriateness

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

### 🎯 **PLANNER REBALANCING ANALYSIS COMPLETE**

**Problem Root Cause Identified**: The current Freudian interpreter contains overly cautious guidance that discourages sexual analysis:

1. **System Prompt Issues**:

   - "Not every dream is sexual" emphasis without balance
   - Strong warnings against sexual interpretation
   - Heavy emphasis on non-sexual theories without balancing libidinal theory

2. **Output Format Restrictions**:

   - `sexualAnalysis` field requires themes to be "clearly present"
   - Guidance emphasizes "not crude interpretation" too strongly
   - Creates too high a bar for sexual theme inclusion

3. **Unused Sexual Symbol Detection**:
   - `identifyPotentialSexualSymbols()` method exists but isn't leveraged
   - Sexual symbols detected but not used to inform analysis approach

**Rebalancing Strategy**:

1. **Prompt Refinement**: Update guidance to encourage appropriate sexual analysis while maintaining sophistication
2. **Symbol Integration**: Utilize sexual symbol detection to inform when sexual analysis is appropriate
3. **Voice Calibration**: Maintain authentic Freudian approach that addresses sexual themes directly but therapeutically
4. **Testing Enhancement**: Create test cases specifically for sexual theme appropriateness

**Quality Standards for Rebalancing**:

- Sexual themes included when contextually relevant (not avoided)
- Maintains therapeutic professionalism and sophistication
- Balances sexual analysis with other psychoanalytic concepts
- Preserves authentic Dr. Freud voice from Berggasse 19 study

**🚀 READY FOR EXECUTOR IMPLEMENTATION**

The rebalancing plan is comprehensive and specific. The Executor can now proceed with updating the prompt guidance to achieve appropriate sexual theme balance while maintaining the sophisticated, authentic Freudian voice.

## Lessons

- **Balance Over Avoidance**: Overcorrecting prompt guidance can eliminate authentic interpretative approaches
- **Symbol Detection Integration**: Technical capabilities should be leveraged in prompt logic, not just implemented
- **Authentic Voice Preservation**: Maintaining authenticity requires allowing appropriate content while preserving professionalism
- **Conditional Logic Refinement**: "ONLY if clearly present" criteria can be too restrictive for nuanced psychological analysis
- **User Feedback Integration**: Real usage patterns reveal when technical implementations miss the mark

# Freudian Dream Interpreter Rebalancing

## Background and Motivation

Rebalancing the Freudian interpreter to address over-avoidance of sexual themes while maintaining sophistication and therapeutic appropriateness.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **Overcautious Prompt Guidance**: Current prompts discourage sexual analysis too strongly
2. **Unused Technical Capabilities**: Sexual symbol detection not integrated into analysis logic
3. **Restrictive Conditional Logic**: Too high bar for sexual theme inclusion
4. **Authenticity vs. Appropriateness**: Need to balance genuine Freudian approach with therapeutic professionalism

### Rebalancing Approach:

**Core Principle**: Freud believed sexual drive (libido) is fundamental to psychology and should be addressed directly but thoughtfully when relevant to dream content.

**Technical Strategy**:

- Refine prompt guidance to encourage rather than discourage appropriate sexual analysis
- Integrate sexual symbol detection into prompt logic
- Lower the bar for sexual theme inclusion while maintaining quality
- Preserve authentic voice while addressing sexual content therapeutically

**Expected Outcome**: Freudian interpreter that includes sexual analysis when contextually appropriate, balanced with other psychoanalytic concepts, maintaining Dr. Freud's authentic analytical approach.
